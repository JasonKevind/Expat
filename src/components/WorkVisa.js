        A work permit is a document issued by the Canadian government that permits foreign nationals to
work in the country for a specific period. Most temporary jobs in Canada require a work permit, and

<h4>Types of Work Permits:</h4>
<h5> Open Work Permit: </h5>An Open Work Permit enables individuals to work for any employer in
Canada without needing a job offer.
<h5> Employer-specific Work Permit:</h5> Tied to a specific employer and job.
<h5> Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA): </h5>To obtain many work permits, employers may
need to acquire a Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) from the Employment and
Social Development Canada (ESDC). This document confirms the need for a foreign worker
and the unavailability of Canadian workers for the job.
<h5> International Mobility Program (IMP):</h5> Under the International Mobility Program (IMP),
certain work permits are exempt from the LMIA requirement. This includes categories such
as intra-company transferees and professionals under international agreements.
 Temporary Foreign Worker Program (TFWP) and International Mobility Program
(IMP): The Temporary Foreign Worker Program (TFWP) is employer-driven, while the
International Mobility Program (IMP) encompasses work permits that are not employer-
specific and are based on other factors like international agreements.
<h5> Intra-Company Transfers:</h5> Intra-Company Transfers allow companies to bring specific
employees to Canada from their overseas offices without requiring an LMIA.
<h5> PGWP – Post Graduate Work Permit:</h5>International students who graduate from a
Designated Learning Institution in Canada are eligible to work for up to three years.
<h5> Work Permit Extensions:</h5> If a foreign worker wishes to extend their stay in Canada, they may
need to apply for a work permit extension before their current permit expires.
<h5> Spousal Work Permits: </h5>The partners of eligible foreign workers can get an open work
permit.Canadian employers are allowed to hire foreign nationals who possess a valid Canada visa to
work temporarily in Canada. The purpose is to address the shortages in Canada&#39;s labor force.
This Canada work permit program operates in collaboration with IRCC (Immigration,
Refugees and Citizenship Canada) and ESDC (Employment and Social Development Canada).
Canadian employers can recruit foreign nationals through the following streams:
<h5>High wage workers</h5>
<h5>Low wage workers</h5>
<h5>Global Talent Stream</h5>
<h5> Foreign Agricultural workers</h5>
<h5> In-home caregivers</h5>
<h4>HIGH WAGE WORKERS</h4>
If a Canadian employer intends to hire a foreign national and pay them a salary above the median
hourly wage of their province or territory, they must recruit them through the Temporary Foreign
Worker Program (TFWP). The first step in this process is to apply for a Labour Market Impact
Assessment (LMIA).
<h4>LOW-WAGE WORKERS</h4>
Canadian employers have the option to hire a foreign national who will be paid less than the median
hourly wage of their province or territory. If an employer chooses to do so, they should use the
Temporary Foreign Worker Program (TFWP) stream designed for this purpose. The first step in this
process is to apply for a Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA).
<h4>GLOBAL TALENT STREAM</h4>
The Global Talent Stream is a pilot program that lasts for two years. It is launched in partnership with
Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) and Employment &amp; Social Development
Canada (ESDC). This program is designed to assist Canadian employers in hiring highly skilled foreign
nationals and is the quickest immigration pathway for individuals willing to enter Canada on a work
visa.
<h4>FOREIGN AGRICULTURAL WORKERS</h4>
Employers seeking to engage in the recruitment of temporary foreign workers for specific
agricultural positions are advised to proceed through this designated stream. By doing so, they can
obtain the necessary permits and approvals required to hire foreign nationals.
<h4>IN-HOME CAREGIVERS</h4>
This particular stream caters specifically to families seeking to employ foreign individuals to provide
care for children, seniors, or individuals with medical requirements. This can be achieved through the in-home caregiver program under the Temporary Foreign Worker Program (TFWP). By utilizing
this program, families have the opportunity to hire temporary foreign workers by obtaining Canada
work permits. These workers can be recruited as caregivers for children or as caregivers for
individuals with significant medical needs. This category of visa is commonly referred to as Work Visa
Sponsorship Canada.
<h4>LMIA EXEMPTION</h4>
Through the LMIA exemption, Canadian employers have the opportunity to waive the LMIA
certificate when hiring foreign nationals for their company. However, there are certain exemptions
that must be met in order to recruit foreign nationals. LMIA exemption has various categories in it:
<ul>
<li> Intra Company Transfer (ICT)</li>
<li> AIPP – Atlantic Immigration Pilot Program</li>
<li> RNIP – Rural and Northern Immigration Pilot Program</li>
<li> YCPP – Yukon Community Pilot Program</li>
</ul>
<h5>Work Permit Duration:</h5> The duration of a work permit may vary depending on factors such as the job
contract, LMIA validity, and other considerations. It may be issued for a few months to several years.
<h5>Application Process:</h5> Individuals who wish to obtain a work permit usually need to file an application
with Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC). In some cases, they may also need to
apply for a temporary resident visa.
<h4>Open Work Permit -</h4>
An open work permit allows individuals to work for any employer, with the exception of those listed
as ineligible due to non-compliance with conditions or those regularly involved in activities such as
striptease, erotic dance, escort services, or erotic massages. Open work permits are only granted in
specific situations. Unlike other work permits, open work permits are not tied to a specific job, so
employers do not need to obtain a labour market impact assessment or provide proof of an offer of
employment. However, individuals applying for an open work permit will typically need to pay the
open work permit holder fee along with the regular work permit fee.
