Studying in Canada can be a great opportunity for international students. Canadian universities and
colleges offer world-class education, diverse cultural experiences, and outstanding post-graduation
opportunities. The Canadian government provides post-study work and immigration options to
international students. Canada is committed to providing high-quality education with a wide range
of specialized diplomas, advanced diplomas, and postgraduate diplomas available. International
students are allowed to work part-time for up to 20 hours per week, either on-campus or off-
campus, to help offset expenses. Canada is also considered one of the safest countries in the world,
providing a safe and secure environment for students.
Canadian universities and colleges offer three intakes for students to begin their studies: Fall
Semester, which starts in September; Winter Semester, which starts in January; and Summer
Semester, which starts in April or May. However, it&#39;s important to note that the Summer Semester
has a limited number of programs and colleges available.
International students who wish to work in Canada while studying need to meet some basic criteria.
They must be at least 18 years old and can work either on-campus or off-campus, but only up to 20
hours per week while they study. During winter or summer vacation holidays, they can work full-
time without needing any work permit. International students who require co-op or internship
programs as part of their studies are allowed to work.
The Canadian government has introduced a streamlined system for processing study permits,
especially for students from China, India, the Philippines, or Vietnam. This stream is called the
Student Direct Stream (SDS) and is a good option for students who want to reduce the risk of visa
rejection. However, the requirements for this stream are very similar to the normal study permit in
Canada. Students must meet some strict language requirements, such as a minimum score of 6 in
IELTS or 7 in French. If they do not meet these requirements, they must apply for a normal study
permit in Canada.

International students in Canada can also bring their spouse or dependent children with them while
they study. The spouse of an international student can apply for a Temporary Resident Visa that
includes an open work permit, allowing them to work for any employer in Canada. They can work in
Canada for the duration of their partner&#39;s student visa. If the spouse wishes to study further, they
may apply for a separate study visa. Study visa holders can also bring their dependent children with
them to Canada, and the children can reside with their parents for the duration of the study visa
period. Children under the age of 18 are permitted to pursue their education in Canada.
