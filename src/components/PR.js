    <h4>About Canada PR </h4>
Express Entry Skilled Immigrant is a category for immigrants who are highly skilled in their respective
occupations. The Canadian government uses an online system called Express Entry to organize and
process applications for skilled workers who want to immigrate to Canada and get permanent
residence status. The system manages three main federal economic programs: Federal Skilled
Worker (FSW), Federal Skilled Trades (FST), and Canadian Experience Class (CEC).
The immigration process can take up to 6 months and the pool of Express Entry analyses and
shortlists the applicants who can contribute 100% to the development of the federal and provincial
economy and are completely eligible. There is no fixed number of immigrants to be selected, and it
is based on the organization&#39;s requirements and the applicant&#39;s skill set.
To apply for a suitable job in a Canadian province, the applicant must create an exclusive Express
Entry Profile that includes their education, skill sets, work experience, language proficiency proof,
and other personal details. The applicants who fit into any of the application streams will get
shortlisted under the candidate pool. However, getting shortlisted under the candidate pool is not
equivalent to receiving the Invitation to Apply (ITA).<br></br>
<h4>The federal government of Canada intakes the skilled immigrants who apply under this process by
following two basic steps:</h4>
1. Assess the Express Entry Profile<br></br>
2. Sending Invitation to Apply for Permanent Residence<br></br>
Applicants who have previously obtained a direct job offer from a provincial employer, and those
who have been approved to get permanent residence, have an added advantage of receiving an ITA
compared to their peer applicants.
<br></br>
When applying for Canadian immigration under the skilled immigrant program, all applicants are
assessed based on their profile details such as education, skill sets, work experience, language
proficiency proof, and other personal details. The assessment is done purely based on the point
system under the Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS). The candidates with the highest CRS score
will receive an Invitation To Apply (ITA) letter, and they must submit their online application for the
concerned job within 60 days.<br></br>
Applicants who do not receive an ITA invite will remain in the Express Entry Pool for up to 12 months
as a maximum time limit to avail of a job. If they haven’t been approached by any Canadian
employers during this time, they need to re-submit their profile for Express Entry under Expression
of Interest (EOI).<br></br>
<h4 className='h44'>To apply for Express Entry:</h4>
you need to follow two steps. Firstly, you need to submit your application, which requires the
following documents: language test results, educational credential assessment report, and a
passport or travel document. Secondly, after submitting your profile and receiving an invitation to
apply for Canadian permanent residency, you will need to submit a more substantial application.
This application includes reference letters, extra identity documents, police clearance certificates,
and the results of a medical examination.
<h4 className='h44'>To be eligible for Express Entry:</h4>
candidates should have a university or college diploma, relevant professional experience, and a
moderate knowledge of English and/or French. Candidates must fulfill the eligibility conditions for
one of three federal programs to submit a profile using the Express Entry system. Reach out to us,
and one of our immigration specialists will help you check your eligibility status.
<h4 className='h44'>To apply for Express Entry as a skilled worker, you must meet the following criteria:</h4>
- Have at least one year of continuous full-time (or comparable part-time) work experience in a
skilled occupation in the last ten years.<br></br>
- Be able to demonstrate a minimum of Canadian Language Benchmark (CLB) seven in either English
or French on an approved language test.
- Completed post-secondary education that is assessed against Canadian standards with an
Education Credential Assessment.<br></br>
Meeting these conditions does not guarantee that you will be invited to apply for permanent
residency in Canada. Candidates with superior profiles will always be chosen above those who only
fulfil the minimum requirements.
<h4 className='h44'>How are Express Entry points calculated?</h4>
The Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) score is frequently referred to when people talk about
Canada&#39;s &quot;Express Entry points.&quot; It&#39;s used to rank individuals in the pool based on various factors
Such as:
<ul>
<li> Age;</li>
<li> Spouse factors;</li>
<li> Level of education;</li>
<li> Proficiency in French or English;</li>
<li> Foreign and Canadian work experience; and</li>
<li> Connections to Canada</li>
</ul>
Get in touch with us to receive a free estimate of your CRS score, and one of our Canadian
immigration experts will be happy to help you out.
<br></br><h4 className='h44'>How much does it cost to apply for Express Entry to Canada?</h4>
The total cost for a single applicant is around CAD 2,300, while for a couple it is approximately CAD
4,500. The cost breakdown is as follows:<br></br>
<div>
- Language tests: approximately 270 CAD<br></br>
- Educational Credential Assessment (ECA): approximately 300 CAD<br></br>
- Biometrics: $85 per person<br></br>
- Government fees: $1,365 for adults and $235 for children<br></br>
- Medical examination fees: on average $450 for adults and $250 for children<br></br>
- Police clearance certificates: on average $100 per country<br></br>
</div>
It is important to note that you do not need to pay any fees when submitting your initial Express
Entry profile. Fees are only required if you are invited to apply for permanent residency in Canada. If
you apply through a PNP, you may be required to pay provincial immigration fees as well as
government processing expenses.<br></br>
In addition, you must demonstrate that you have sufficient funds to support your relocation to
Canada, unless you are applying under the Canadian Experience Class program or have a legally
arranged employment offer. These funds are not paid to the government, but you must have access
to them to be granted a permanent residence visa.<br></br>
<h4 className='h44'>How can I increase my CRS score?</h4>
<h4>1. RETAKE THE IELTS - </h4> To increase your chances of being selected for Express Entry under the
Federal Skilled Worker program, it is recommended that you improve your IELTS score. A good IELTS
score can earn you up to 160 CRS points. However, if you have a good IELTS score and post-
secondary education, you can get an additional 50 points. On the other hand, if you have a good
IELTS score and at least three years of work experience, you can earn an additional 50 points.
To be eligible for Express Entry under the Federal Skilled Worker program, you must have a Canadian
Language Benchmark (CLB) 7 score, which is at least 6.0 on each language ability on the IELTS. But if
you achieve a CLB 9 in all language abilities, you could earn up to 260 points solely for your language
ability.<br></br>
You can take the IELTS test as many times as you want. If you submit your profile to the pool, you
can even update your Express Entry profile with new IELTS test results. At Expats Immigration, we
provide our Express Entry clients with IELTS training to help them meet the required score.
Tip for immigrants: Register for the IELTS test early. You can retake the test if you don&#39;t get the
desired score before submitting your profile. You can also update your profile later, but if you do it
after entering the pool, you might miss out on draws.
<br></br>
<h4>2. WORK EXPERIENCE - </h4>Your work experience is a significant factor in determining your Express
Entry points. However, gaining more years of work experience just to increase your Express Entry
points is not always straightforward.
<br></br>
<h5>Tip for immigrants: Having Canadian work experience can open up many immigration
opportunities in Canada.</h5>
Is a job offer required for Express Entry?<br></br>
No, a job offer is not required for Express Entry. The majority of Express Entry candidates do not
have a formal job offer in Canada. However, if you have a genuine job offer in Canada, it can
increase your CRS score by up to 200 points.
<br></br>
<h4 className='h44'>About PNP -</h4>
<h4 className='h44'>Provincial Nominee Programs (PNPs)</h4>
Canada is a diverse country with a strong economy, offering numerous job opportunities in each of
its provinces and territories. It is a land of breathtaking beauty with a rich history, snow-capped
mountains, vast coastlines, epic hiking trails, rolling plateaus, forested valleys, and stunning blue
waters.<br></br>
If you&#39;re interested in immigrating to a specific Canadian province or territory, you can apply for a
Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) to gain permanent residency. The PNP program is a successful
tool for economic growth across Canada, supporting employment, investment, entrepreneurship,
and spending.<br></br>
The Provincial Nominee Program is the easiest way to settle in Canada and offers different streams
based on categories. For instance, if you have completed your education in Canada, you will fall
under a different stream, while skilled workers like engineers or lawyers will have their own separate
stream.<br></br>
Some provinces in Canada prefer to welcome immigrants who have prior experience in occupations
that are in demand, while others prioritize those who have close connections with the province,
either through education, employment, or relatives.<br></br>
Each province has its own eligibility and requirements according to their demographic needs. For
example, one province may prioritize immigrants with prior experience in a particular occupation,
while another may prioritize those with French language skills.<br></br>
Provincial Nominee Programs allow provinces to welcome individuals to work, settle, and contribute
to their community. Most provinces require immigrants to have some connection with them, either
through work, study, or a job offer from an employer in that province.<br></br>

<h4 className='h44'>Benefits of the PNP program</h4>
The Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) can speed up the process of obtaining permanent residency
in Canada. Once they receive a PNP nomination, applicants can live and work in Canada indefinitely.
This program is well-suited for young immigrants with strong language skills, high levels of
education, skilled work experience, and prior Canadian connections. PNP immigrants also have a
higher chance of integrating into the Canadian job market, earning high wages, and experiencing low
rates of unemployment.
<br></br>
To apply for the PNP program, candidates can either apply directly (known as a base nomination) or
be selected by a provincial government through the Express Entry application pool (known as an
enhanced nomination). If successful in getting nominated by a province, Express Entry candidates
will automatically receive an additional 600 Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) points on their
Express Entry application.
<br></br>

<h4 className='h44'>Ways to apply for PNP?</h4>
Many immigrants choose the Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) because it allows them to apply for
Canadian immigration even if their profile doesn&#39;t match the requirements for the Express Entry
program. If they have skills that are in demand in a particular region, they may be eligible for the
PNP. There are two ways to apply for the Provincial Nominee Program in Canada:
<ul>
    <li>Non-Express Entry method</li>
<li> Express Entry method.</li>
</ul>
<h4 className='h44'>1. Non-Express Entry Method</h4>
Immigrants who wish to settle in Canada can apply directly to the provinces or territories where
their skills are in demand. To do this, they must submit an Expression of Interest (EOI) to the
province, indicating their interest in applying to that particular province. If the province selects their
profile, the individual will receive a Notification of Interest (NOI) and will be given a certain period of
time to submit all the required documents. The province will verify the documents and ensure that
they match the National Occupational Classification (NOC). If the documents match the NOC, the
individual will receive a Letter of Invitation (LOI), which will add 600 CRS points to their profile.
<h4 className='h44'>2. Express Entry Method</h4>
If an immigrant wants to apply for permanent residency in Canada, they can create an express entry
profile and apply through the Express Entry Method. This allows them to select a province or
territory of their choice and apply directly for the provincial nomination, based on the availability of
vacancies in the region.
The Express Entry visa is a common pathway for entering Canada, but if an individual does not meet
the Express Entry CRS score requirements, they can still apply for the Provincial Nominee Program.
This is a straightforward way to obtain permanent residency, as receiving the nomination increases
the applicant&#39;s CRS score to 600. This is one of the significant benefits of the nominee programs.
The Provincial Nominee Program was designed as an alternative for immigrants whose profiles did
not get selected through the Express Entry System. All the provinces have to agree with the
Canadian government before nominating immigrants to their province, except for Quebec and
Nunavut. Quebec has its own Provincial Nominee Program, which is not connected with the other
provinces.

<h4 className='h44'>Provincial Nominee Overview</h4>
<h4 className='h44'>What are Provincial Nominee Programs?</h4>

With the exception of Quebec and Nunavut, each Canadian province has established multiple PNP
streams to help them achieve their respective immigration goals. However, the qualifying
requirements and application procedures differ for each PNP since they are designed to match the
specific needs of each province. PNPs are a popular choice because they may be the fastest route to
obtaining permanent residency in Canada.
It&#39;s important to note that Canada&#39;s provinces are not authorized to grant permanent residency
status on their own. All decisions regarding permanent residency must be approved at the national
level by the federal government. Therefore, the provincial programs are referred to as &quot;nominee&quot;
programs.<br></br>
A successful PNP applicant will be nominated by the province to apply for permanent residency with
the federal government. This means that applying for a PNP is always the first step in a two-phase
process. Interested immigrants must first obtain authorization at the provincial level before applying
to the federal level.<br></br>
Here&#39;s a list of the Canadian provinces and territories that have their own Provincial Nominee
Program (PNP):<br></br>
<ul>
- Alberta<br></br>
- British Columbia<br></br>
- Manitoba<br></br>
- New Brunswick<br></br>
- Newfoundland and Labrador<br></br>
- Northwest Territories<br></br>
- Nova Scotia<br></br>
- Ontario<br></br>
- Prince Edward Island<br></br>
- Quebec<br></br>
- Saskatchewan<br></br>
- Yukon<br></br>
</ul>
If you&#39;re interested in applying for a PNP, you should check the eligibility requirements for each
province to see which one suits you best.<br></br>
<h4 className='h44'>Express Entry Provincial Nominee Programs?</h4>
Canada introduced the Express Entry system in 2015 to manage permanent residence applications
for major economic immigration programs. Many provinces and territories have since created
improved Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) streams that are compatible with Express Entry. To be
eligible for these PNPs, applicants are required to have an Express Entry profile.
If an application is nominated through an Express Entry-aligned PNP, the applicant can earn 600
additional Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) points, which almost guarantees an invitation to
apply (ITA) for permanent residence in the next Express Entry draw. However, if an applicant
receives a nomination through a PNP that is not aligned with Express Entry, they must apply for
permanent residence as a provincial nominee using a non-Express Entry federal application. These
non-Express Entry federal applications can take longer to process compared to computerized
Express Entry applications.
<h4 className='h44'>Am I eligible for a Canadian PNP?</h4>

The criteria for becoming eligible for Provincial Nominee Programs (PNPs) vary from province to
province, as they are part of an economic immigration policy. They are typically designed to attract
individuals who can quickly contribute to the economy and are more likely to settle in the province. 
Therefore, some PNPs give priority to individuals who have work experience in high-demand
occupations in their province, while others favor those who have a personal connection to the
province, such as a relative, since they are more likely to stay. 
Young applicants who possess excellent language proficiency, high levels of education, and skilled
work experience are generally more successful, as with most economic immigration programs.
However, it is recommended that you refer to the list of PNPs mentioned above to determine the
specific qualifying criteria for each program.
<h4 className='h44'>Can I immigrate through a PNP without a job offer?</h4>
There are several Provincial Nominee Programs (PNPs) that international candidates can apply for
even without a job offer in Canada. These programs are designed for candidates with skills or work
experience that can help address the province&#39;s labour market or demographic shortages.
Can I qualify for a PNP if I don’t qualify for Express Entry?
Many Provincial Nominee Programs (PNPs) require applicants to have an active profile in the Express
Entry pool. However, some provinces make exceptions and issue nominations to applicants who are
not eligible for Express Entry. The eligibility requirements for these programs vary, so it is best to
consult with a representative to discuss your eligibility. If you receive a nomination through a PNP,
you must then submit a permanent resident application to the federal government.
If the PNP is not aligned with Express Entry, the federal permanent residency application must be
submitted through a different portal or by paper. Keep in mind that a non-Express Entry PNP
application typically takes longer to process.
<h4 className='h44'>What are the requirements for Canada’s PNPs?</h4>
Provinces and territories have specific requirements for language proficiency, education, and work
experience for immigration applicants. They look for candidates who meet their region&#39;s labor
market requirements. You must also demonstrate your ability to contribute to the local economy
and show a genuine desire to live in the province or area you are applying for.
